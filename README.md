# BinaryTreeJS
A Binary Tree Implementation in JavaScript

So far has two functions:
1. Insert - a function to insert new nodes/leaves into the tree
2. Inorder Traversal - a function to traverse through the tree printing out the value of each node

Both these functions are implemented using recursion.
